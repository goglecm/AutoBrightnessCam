TODO list:

- add support for seamless brightness change
- add some sort of tap filtering when reading the ambient brightness
- remove asserts and replace them with logs
- add tests to check for errors
- add support for gmock
- generalise project path (use the full to a makefile?)
- add more build flags

Requirements:

Functional requirements:

Requirement:
    What:
    - the backlight brightness is periodically set to the ambient brightness
    When:
    - the laptop is on battery
    Conditions:
    - the set brightness does not exceed the maximum brightness threshold
    - the set brightness is not less than the minimum brightness threshold

Requirement:
    What:
    - the minimum and maximum brightness thresholds are read from a
      configuration file
    When:
    - initially, before any brightness changes

Requirement:
    What:
    - the backlight brightness is set to the maximum brightness threshold
    When:
    - the laptop is charging

Requirement:
    What:
    - the backlight brightness is not changed
    When:
    - the laptop lid is closed
    - the power manager is in reduced brightness mode
    - the power manager is in blank display mode

Requirement:
    What:
    - the default state of the laptop battery is assumed to be charging
    When:
    - the state of the laptop battery could not be determined

Requirement:
    What:
    - the default state of the laptop lid is assumed to be open
    When:
    - the state of the laptop lid cannot be determined

Requirement:
    What:
    - the power manager mode is assumed to be active (default)
    When:
    - the power manager mode cannot be determined

Requirement:
    What:
    - the application issues an error and exits
    When:
    - the brightness could not be updated during 3*N seconds

Requirement:
    What:
    - the N value, minimum and maximum brightness thresholds are set to their
      default values and a warning is issued by the application
    When:
    - the configuration file does not exist
    - the configuration file is corrupt or has invalid configuration

Dependencies:

- (interface done) [mandatory] backlight brightness control
- (interface done) [mandatory] ambient light sensor control
- (interface done) [mandatory] time control (to be able to count time)
- [optional] filesystem (for the configuration file)
- [optional] laptop battery state
- [optional] laptop lid state
- [optional] power manager mode

----

Future ideas:

- allow the user to point the paths for any unavailable optional features
